# Wordle Recreation (Backend)
The "Wordle Recreation" project is a Java-based implementation of a word-guessing game inspired by the popular game "Wordle." The project includes several classes, each contributing to the game's functionality. The ExtendedLetter Class represents an extended version of the Letter class, introducing additional attributes such as content, family, and relatedness. It implements a Singleton pattern and provides methods for comparison and string representation. The Letter Class represents a basic letter with a character and label, offering methods for comparison and label manipulation. The LinearNode Class serves as a node in a linked list. The TestWordLL Class functions as a testing framework, evaluating aspects like letter equality and WordLL functionality. The Word Class represents a word in the game, utilizing linked structures to store Letter objects. The WordLL Class manages the game's logic, storing mystery words and player guesses, with methods for trying words and displaying past guesses.

In the context of gameplay, players attempt to deduce a mystery word through successive guesses, receiving feedback on correct and incorrect positions. The project introduces a unique aspect by incorporating Euchre cards as part of the game's challenge. The testing framework ensures the correctness of the implemented classes and methods, providing a robust foundation for the Wordle Recreation game. Overall, this project combines object-oriented design, linked structures, and game mechanics to recreate the Wordle experience in a Java environment, offering both a traditional word-guessing mode and a distinctive card-based challenge for players.
