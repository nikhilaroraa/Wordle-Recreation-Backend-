# Wordle Recreation (Backend)
This project aims to explore and expand on the Wordle concept, offering tools to create variants with arbitrary word lengths, guess limits, and a wider range of letters beyond A-Z. The main class, WordLL, serves as a non-graphical text-based utility, while WordLLExamples provides simple interfaces. The example run (shown in GitHub) showcases the utility in action, with bolded words representing user guesses and labels such as "-", "+", and "!" indicating unused, used, and correct letters, respectively. This versatile approach allows for creative adaptations of the Wordle game, transcending numerical and textual constraints, making it a dynamic tool for crafting unique Wordle-esque experiences.
